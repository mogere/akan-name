                    <p>In Ghana, according to Akan culture, once a child is born, their first name 
                        they are given depends entirely on the day of the week they have been born.
                        For every day of the week, there is a special specific name which you are 
                        given; of course depending on your gender also ;). In this application, we 
                        will take you on a trip to Ghana to find out what your name would be. If 
                        you do not know which day you were born, worry not, just fill in the details
                        as requested below and the app will do it all for you.
